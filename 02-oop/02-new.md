# New
> The `new` operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

```js
const bob = new Person("Bob", 42);
```

The `new` operator before a function call specifies that the `this` used within that function is a new instance of `this`.  The `new` operator gives us control of the `this` context!  Yay!
